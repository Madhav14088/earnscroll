# earnscroll
EarnScroll is an Android productivity application designed to reduce excessive social media usage by introducing a physical effort–based unlocking mechanism. Instead of freely accessing distracting apps, users must complete a set number of push-ups to unlock them for a limited duration.

The app leverages Android Accessibility Services to monitor foreground applications and temporarily block selected apps. It integrates real-time pose detection using AI to count push-ups through the device camera. Once the required repetitions are completed, the selected apps are unlocked for a configurable time period.
The goal of this project is to combine behavioral psychology and artificial intelligence to promote healthier screen habits through physical activity and self-discipline.
